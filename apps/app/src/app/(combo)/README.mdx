# The combo folder is an experiment for showing different pages to authed and non-authed users

This can't be done with the current setup where we check auth state of a user at top-level layout in each of protected and public folders

## Two options

1 - Only show to authed users and keep them in protected
2 - Show different versions for auth and non-auth users similar to FB

This folder (combo) is aiming at option 2.

There are two versions of the Provider component:
1. - ComboSidebarLayoutProvider (used in /freelance)
2. - ComboSidebarLayoutProvider2 (used in /companies)

It is not yet decided which is the better version nor if the combo folder is even a good solution.
